I'm a full-stack developer with a strong background in the JavaScript ecosystem, specializing in React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, and TypeScript. I have a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms and a passion for low-level programming, always eager to explore how things work under the hood.

I have deep knowledge in C and Rust, leveraging them for system-level programming and performance optimization. I love to understand how things work at a fundamental level and often develop things from scratch to gain full control over my projects.

Currently, my go-to for front-end development is React, while I focus on building scalable and efficient back-end systems with Rust and developing native iOS applications with Swift. I thrive on exploring new challenges and pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in software development.
